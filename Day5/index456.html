    <h1>Interviews</h1>
    <p>An interview is a psychological and sociological instrument. It is an
        interaction between two or more persons for a specific purpose, in
        which the interviewer asks the interviewee specific questions in order
        to assess his/her suitability for recruitment, admission, or promotion. </p>
        <p>We may have to face interviews at different times in our life. If
            we consider an interview just as an interaction between two or more
            people, we may not feel nervous to face the panel members of an
            interview. However, the thought ‘I am being observed and assessed by
            each member’ often makes one nervous</p>
            <p>Although the nature of interviews may be different for different
                organizations, several rules are common for all. For example, for any
                job interview, one needs to prepare or update one’s résumé, know
                the profile of the company, prepare answers for commonly asked
                questions, etc.</p>
                <p>Telling In a telling interview, the flow of communication is almost entirely one way—
                    downwards. It is used most effectively in a directing, time-constrained situation; but it can
                    cause hostility and defensive behaviour when the employee does not have the opportunity to
                    participate</p>
